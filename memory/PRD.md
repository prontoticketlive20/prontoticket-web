### Routes

- `/evento/:id/asientos` - Seat Selection Page
- `/evento/:id/resumen` - Purchase Summary Page
- `/evento/:id/checkout` - Checkout Page (NEW)

## Mock Data
All data is hardcoded in `/app/frontend/src/data/mockEvents.js`

**Events with saleType property:**
- Event 1: Festival Musical (saleType = "general") - Ticket selection modal only
- Event 2: Teatro Noche de Gala (saleType = "seated") - Seat map only
- Event 3: Concierto Internacional (saleType = "general") - Ticket selection modal only

**Purchase Flow Rules:**
- `saleType = "seated"`: Shows ONLY seat map flow, NO ticket selectors
- `saleType = "general"`: Shows ONLY ticket type/quantity selection, NO seat map
- **Invalid/missing saleType**: Shows developer warning, blocks purchase

**saleType Validation:**
- Valid values: `"seated"` | `"general"`
- If missing or invalid:
  - Console error with event details
  - Visual warning banner on event page
  - Purchase button disabled
  - Flow completely blocked

---

## Prioritized Backlog

### P1 - High Priority
- Autocomplete functionality in homepage search bar
- Advanced filtering options (category, price range)

### P2 - Medium Priority
- User authentication (profiles, purchase history)
- Checkout/payment integration page

### P3 - Low Priority (Future)
- Real-time seat availability
- Seats.io actual integration
- Email confirmation flow

---

## Known Technical Notes
- **Babel Plugin Issue**: Complex nested imports from `mockEvents.js` can cause "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors. Solution: Use inline mock data or simplified imports in components.
- **Project is 100% MOCKED** - No backend, no API calls, no database

---

## User Preferences
- **Language**: Spanish (ES)
- **Theme**: Dark mode with blue/orange accents
- **Approach**: Iterative development with visual confirmation
