## Mock Data
All data is hardcoded in `/app/frontend/src/data/mockEvents.js`

**Events with saleType property:**
- Event 1: Festival Musical (saleType = "general") - Ticket selection modal only
- Event 2: Teatro Noche de Gala (saleType = "seated") - Seat map only
- Event 3: Concierto Internacional (saleType = "general") - Ticket selection modal only

**Purchase Flow Rules:**
- `saleType = "seated"`: Shows ONLY seat map flow, NO ticket selectors
- `saleType = "general"`: Shows ONLY ticket type/quantity selection, NO seat map
- **Invalid/missing saleType**: Shows developer warning, blocks purchase

**Mock Logged-in User:**
```javascript
{
  id: 'user-123',
  firstName: 'Juan',
  lastName: 'García',
  email: 'juan.garcia@email.com',
  phone: '+52 55 1234 5678',
  isLoggedIn: true
}
```

## Prioritized Backlog

### P1 - High Priority
- Real Stripe Payment Element integration (requires backend)
- User authentication system (login/register/profile)

### P2 - Medium Priority  
- Autocomplete functionality in homepage search bar
- Advanced filtering options (category, price range, date)
- Purchase history page

### P3 - Low Priority (Future)
- Real-time seat availability
- Seats.io actual integration
- Email confirmation flow with real emails
- Multi-language support (currently UI only)

---

## Known Technical Notes
- **Babel Plugin Issue**: Complex nested imports from `mockEvents.js` can cause "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors. Solution: Use inline mock data or simplified imports in components.
- **Project is 100% MOCKED** - No backend, no API calls, no database
- **Payment Flow**: Mock simulation with 90% success rate for demo purposes
- **Terms Checkbox**: Has overlay interception - requires force=True for automated testing

## Test Results (Feb 10, 2026)
- **Frontend Success Rate**: 100%
- **Complete Purchase Flow**: Verified working
- **Test Report**: `/app/test_reports/iteration_2.json`
